# Refactoring

The following is a refactoring exercise presented on Mexico on Rails #14, compromised of code found on an old branch of a legacy application written in Ruby on Rails. The branch was untested, so the testing setup was only done for this exercise and its rather crude, apologies! 

For a number of reasons, the entire app cannot be uploaded, so there will only be 3 files on this repo: conekta\_controller.rb which is the main object of the exercise, conekta\_controller\_spec.rb which was used to test it and this readme file.

Follow the commit history to see the evolution of the code.

Cheers,
Ale
